### Patch Changes

- [#155](https://github.com/enboxorg/enbox/pull/155) [`b25be29`](https://github.com/enboxorg/enbox/commit/b25be292c22be509c28a40998ca1457ac7d6b5e7) Thanks [@LiranCohen](https://github.com/LiranCohen)! - fix: publish all packages so exported symbols match cross-package imports

  The agent package ships prototyping code that imports symbols (AesKw,
  Secp256r1, Hkdf, etc.) from @enbox/crypto and other packages. These
  symbols exist in the source but were not in the published versions.
  Bumping all packages ensures the published dist matches the current source.

### Patch Changes

- [#147](https://github.com/enboxorg/enbox/pull/147) [`8042e15`](https://github.com/enboxorg/enbox/commit/8042e1576c71cc02c4abd2aa35f9d7dc635346ca) Thanks [@LiranCohen](https://github.com/LiranCohen)! - fix: publish new versions to fix MessagesSync export chain

  @enbox/agent@0.1.1 imports MessagesSync from @enbox/dwn-sdk-js, but
  @enbox/dwn-sdk-js@0.0.2 was published before that export was added.
  This bumps all three packages so downstream consumers (demo apps) can
  resolve the full dependency chain.
