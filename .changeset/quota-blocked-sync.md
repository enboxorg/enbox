feat(agent): graceful, self-healing handling of quota-blocked sync pushes + observable per-remote sync status

Sync pushes rejected for tenant storage/message quota are no longer retried forever (the console-error flood that spun the remote). They are now detected precisely (`isQuotaExceededError`, newly exported from `@enbox/dwn-clients`) and deferred on a per-link, per-message exponential-backoff probe. Feed checkpoints may advance past the explicit omission, so a blocked message neither stalls newer records nor prevents other remotes from progressing; due and manual retries target the omitted CID independently of that checkpoint. If a later update or tombstone makes the old bytes unreachable, its acknowledgement converts the block into a resolved per-link omission: it is healthy, never retried, and remains durable only long enough to explain the intentional feed-CID difference.

Replicated metadata-only historical writes continue through storage-quota preflight without charging their declared payload size, while message-count quota and all normal data-bearing quota checks remain enforced. This lets a later tombstone or smaller update replay its retained initial-write dependency without exposing a dataless current record. Same-CID data retries against ancestry-only storage are deferred instead of falsely acknowledged, embedded message data is rejected in favor of the validated transport field, and storage reporting now counts only latest base-state data rather than metadata-only history.

New observability, re-exported through `@enbox/browser` for dapp "remotes" panels: `SyncEngine.getRemoteSyncStatus()` returns a per-`(tenant, remote)` snapshot (`healthy | quota-blocked | degraded | offline`, blocked count, next-probe time, last error/activity); `SyncEngine.retryRemoteNow()` directly re-probes only the selected remote; `push:quota-blocked` / `push:quota-cleared` events include durable timing and clear resolution; and `SyncHealthSummary` gains `quotaBlockedMessageCount`.
