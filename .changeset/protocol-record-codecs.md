Replace phantom schema-map typing with runtime record codecs. Typed records now encode and decode through their protocol declaration, expose application values through `Record.value()`, and use `within` as the single hierarchy selector. Remove the superseded schema-map types, caller-controlled `Record.update()` data-format overrides, generic `RecordData.json<T>()`, and root utilities namespace. Typed protocol declarations reject `$ref` composition until referenced protocol metadata can be supplied explicitly.

Replace the public `generateTypes()` and `CodegenOptions.emitDefinition` codegen surface with `generateProtocolModule()`, which emits complete codec-backed protocol modules from protocol definitions and declared MIME formats. Expose the codec primitives through the browser and CLI facades.
