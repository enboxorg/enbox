perf(connect): eliminate redundant remote ProtocolsConfigure send and cap per-request budget in the wallet "Authorizing…" hot path

Two fixes that together remove the dominant tail-latency in `submitConnectResponse`:

1. **`@enbox/agent` — `prepareProtocol` no longer issues a redundant remote send when the protocol is already installed locally.** The wallet's own `prepareProtocol` (in `@enbox/web-wallet`) runs *before* `submitConnectResponse` and is the canonical place that fans the protocol out to every owner DWN endpoint in parallel. The agent only needs to verify the protocol is installed locally so it can sign / encrypt grants for it. The "exists locally" branch now performs a single local `ProtocolsQuery` and returns — turning the previous sequential per-endpoint legacy `agent.sendDwnRequest` (which could burn the underlying HTTP client's 4×30 s retry budget on a single unhealthy endpoint, *per protocol*) into a ~10 ms local DB read. The "missing locally" safety-fallback branch now configures the protocol locally via `processDwnRequest` and then fans out to every endpoint in parallel using the existing `mapConcurrentSettled` + `CONNECT_FANOUT_CONCURRENCY` primitive (best-effort — sync delivers any missed copies eventually).

2. **`@enbox/dwn-clients` — `DwnRpcRequest` now accepts an optional `signal: AbortSignal`, plumbed through `HttpDwnRpcClient.sendDwnRequest` / `fetchWithRetry` via `AbortSignal.any([caller, perAttemptTimeout])`.** Aborting short-circuits the retry loop (`AbortError` is non-retryable). The connect flow uses this with a 10 s per-request budget on every connect-flow `agent.rpc.sendDwnRequest` (configure fan-out + permission grants + revocation grants) so a single unhealthy DWN endpoint can no longer stall the user-visible "Authorizing…" spinner for minutes.

Test coverage:

- `packages/agent/tests/connect.spec.ts` — wall-clock parallelism assertion, AbortSignal presence assertion, and a "one endpoint hangs forever" scenario whose end-to-end completes well under the per-request budget.
- `packages/dwn-clients/tests/http-dwn-rpc-client.spec.ts` — caller signal is plumbed to fetch and abort short-circuits the retry loop on the very first attempt.
- All existing `connect.spec.ts` assertions for `prepareProtocol` updated to match the new "skip redundant remote send when local" + "parallel fan-out via RPC client when missing locally" shape.
